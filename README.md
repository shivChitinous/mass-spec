## Modelling Ion Traps and Mass Analysers

Explore the physics of ion traps and mass analysers to find out how they effectively trap single ions in a potential despite the constraints of [Earnshaw's Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnshaw%27s_theorem). Play around with different charge-to-mass ratios, electromagnetic potentials and much else.
